## Project Description

### ✏️ The reason for planning.
Code Pin was planned due to the inconvenience of having to search again for code snippets that users frequently bookmark or save for later use. It aims to provide a space where users can collect and manage their favorite code snippets, easily find them when needed, and share and search for code that can help solve problems.

### ⛳️ Goal

- Provide support to quickly solve coding problems through the code search function.   
<br/>

- Forming a community where developers can share their experiences and knowledge with each other.   
<br/>

- Provide the ability to save links to sites containing code, along with a feature to add supplementary explanations to clearly distinguish the details of the code.

### 🎯 Target
- Programmers, developers, and all IT professionals
<br/>

- Users from various fields who require code

### 🥲 Experienced issues
- Although coding could not commence due to the lack of finalized content and design details, through repeated meetings with team members, the structure was gradually completed
<br/>

- When we started coding in earnest, there were technical shortcomings, but by researching and studying, we were able to resolve these technical deficiencies.

## 🧭 Branding
The brand name CodePin combines the meanings of code and pin. Here, "code" refers to __programming languages__ or __scripts__, and "pin" signifies the act of securing or __saving__ the code.

### Logo Design Ideas

We decided on a clean and simple feel for the logo, focusing on a combination of code and pin.
